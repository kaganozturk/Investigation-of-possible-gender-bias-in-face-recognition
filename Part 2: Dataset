CelebA-HQ and CelebAMask-HQ datasets are used for the experiments.
### CelebA-HQ
This dataset consists of 30,000 face images at 1024 x 1024 resolution. It is a high quality version of CelebA dataset. Several image processing steps are applied to obtain consistent quality and center the images on the facial region. These steps include: artifact removal, 4x super-resolution, mirror padding, Gaussian filtering, cropping and resampling. The details of the dataset can be found in [PROGRESSIVE GROWING OF GANS FOR IMPROVED QUALITY, STABILITY, AND VARIATION](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of/karras2018iclr-paper.pdf)
