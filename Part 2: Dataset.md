CelebA-HQ and CelebAMask-HQ datasets are used for the experiments.
### CelebA-HQ
This dataset consists of 30,000 face images at 1024 x 1024 resolution. It is a high quality version of the CelebA dataset. Several image processing steps are applied to obtain consistent quality and center the images on the facial region. These steps include: artifact removal, 4x super-resolution, mirror padding, Gaussian filtering, cropping and resampling. The details of the dataset can be found in **Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation**.(https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of/karras2018iclr-paper.pdf)
### CelebAMask-HQ
The dataset consist of 30,000 hand-annotated face images of the CelebA-HQ. Resolution size of 512 x 512 is preferred instead of 1024 x 1024 to reduce the cost of labelling. 19 categories is used to annotated images such as, ‘skin’, ‘nose’, ‘eyes’, ‘eyebrows’, ‘ears’, ‘mouth’, ‘lip’, ‘hair’, ‘hat’, ‘eyeglass’, ‘earring’, ‘necklace’, ‘neck’, and ‘cloth’. Addition to these categories ‘beard’ and ‘mustache’ regions are annotated in this project. The paper about the dataset can be found **MaskGAN: Towards Diverse and Interactive Facial Image Manipulation**.(https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Lee_MaskGAN_Towards_Diverse_and_Interactive_Facial_Image_Manipulation_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)
